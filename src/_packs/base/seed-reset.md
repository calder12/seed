## About

By default, this pack contains the following CSS reset styles:

* [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
* [Bootstrap V4's Reboot](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_reboot.scss)
* [Bootstrap V4's Print](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_print.scss)

Bootstrap's reset styles have been slightly adjusted to remove Bootstrap specific styles.

It is recommended that `seed-reset` be imported as near to the top of your SCSS as possible. Reset styles are designed to ensure that elements more consistent and easier to stylize. Think of it as making sure the ground is level __before__ building your house on top of it.

```main.scss
// Reset
@import "pack/seed-reset/_index";

// Everything else
@import "./components/alert";
@import "./components/button";
// etcâ€¦
```

## Customization


`seed-reset` uses the following variables in it's config:

``` _config.scss
$seed-reset-enable-normalize: true !default;
$seed-reset-enable-print: true !default;
$seed-reset-enable-reboot: true !default;
```

You can enable or disable any of the included reset styles by setting the variable as `false` before importing the `seed-reset` pack.

```main.scss
// Disable Bootstrap's reboot reset styles from seed-reset
$seed-reset-enable-reboot: false;

@import "pack/seed-reset/_index";
```
