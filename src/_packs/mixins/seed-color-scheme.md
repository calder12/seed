## About

`seed-color-scheme` was created to improve consistency and maintainability with color variables inside a Sass project. We believe that all colors, especially high-use/brand colors **should be variablized**.


### The problem

The current convention is to store all color variables in a variables file, which looks like this:

```_variables.scss
$blue: #3197D6;
$light-blue: #DAF1FF;
$dark-blue: #1F5E89;
$darkest-blue: #143D57;

$hero-background: $blue;
$secondary-nav-background: $dark-blue;
```

Things start to get messy when your color palette grows and when you create variables to reference color variables (e.g. `$hero-background`).


### The solution

We believe the best way to organize your colors is to use a Sass [map](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps):

```_colors.scss
// Create our color scheme map
$colors: (
  blue: (
    default: #3197D6,
    light: #DAF1FF,
    dark: #1F5E89,
    darkest: #143D57
  )
);
```

Now we just need a way to access the color value to use it in our styles. The `seed-color-scheme` function/mixin combo makes it easy!

```_colors.scss
// Import the seed-color-scheme pack
@import "pack/seed-color-scheme/_index";

// Create our color scheme map
$colors: (
  blue: (
    default: #3197D6,
    light: #DAF1FF,
    dark: #1F5E89,
    darkest: #143D57
  )
);

// Create the color scheme
@include _color($colors);

// Use the color
.hero {
  background: _color(blue, default);
}
```

## Usage

The color scheming system requires using both the `_color` mixin and function to work. The mixin registers the color maps (regular Sass maps) into the global color scheme configuration. The function retrieves the color value from the global color scheme configuration.


### _color (Function)

**_color(argumentâ€¦)**

**arguments**<br>
Type: `string`<br>
Description: Comma separated strings that correspond to the color scheme map.

```_example.scss
.element {
  background: _color(blue, primary);
  color: _color(text, light);
}
```

Note: The `_color` function can only get colors adding to the color scheme via the `@include _color` mixin.



### _color (Mixin)

**_color($map)**

**$map**<br>
Type: `map`<br>
Description: A Sass map consisting of color values. Nested maps are allowed.

```_example.scss
// Create the custom color map
$my-colors: (
  brand: (
    primary: (
      red: red,
      blue: blue
    ),
    secondary: (
      yellow: yellow
    )
  ),
  text: black,
  link: purple
);

// Adding it to the color scheme
@include _color($my-colors);
```

Note: Colors are only accessibile to the `_color` function after it's been added to the color scheme via the `@include _color` mixin.
