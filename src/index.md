We believe design has the power to do incredible things for people, especially when it's clear, concise and consistent. As Help Scout grows it's critical for people's experience with the brand to remain predictable, yet delightful.

This style guide is our brand's playbook: a way of presenting people with a polished brand experience in all facets, but also a way to empower members of the Help Scout team to move quickly and do excellent work.

## What's Included

A brand is so much more than a logo. To us, it encompasses all things that make up someone's perception of the company. For this reason, the style guide presents guidelines along three facets:

Visuals

Copy

Code

## Open Source

Front-end markup in Help Scout is based on an open source toolset called [Seed](/seed/guides/). It's a CSS framework for developing complex web apps, but we also power the [Help Scout marketing site](https://www.helpscout.net) with it.
