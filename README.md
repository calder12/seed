# Seed CSS
==========

## Requirements
- Ruby
- Bundler
- Node
- Gulp


##### Ruby
If you do not have Ruby on your system, check out [this guide](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) from rbenv.


##### Bundler
Once you have Ruby installed on your machine, run the following command to install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
```
gem install bundler
```

##### Node
If you do not have Node installed on your machine, we recommend installing it using [Homebrew](https://github.com/customerio/mvp#homebrew).

Run the following command in your command line:
```
brew install node
```


##### Gulp
Help Scout's styleguide site is compiled using Gulp. See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) guide for more information.

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```


## Getting started

Run the following to install all the node things:
```
npm install
```

When you're ready, run the following to fire it up! (P.S. It *should* automatically resolve/install ruby and node things for you)
```
gulp
```
